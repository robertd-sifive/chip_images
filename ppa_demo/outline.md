# Bringing Physical Design into SCS 

## Goals
* Estimate “cost” of configuration choices
    - How much area?
    - How much power?
    - How much I/O?
    - Compute cost for PNR/timing optimization?
    - Process targets
    - Yield

## What is physical design?
* Logic synthesis
* Technology mapping
* Placement
* Routing
* Pads

## Challenges
* Designs
    - 
* Compute time
    - Abstraction levels
    - Combinations
* Licensing

## Performance
* Benchmarking
    - Drystone
* Power
    - static
    - dynamic
* Area

## Machine learning
* Data collection comes first
    - Distributed processing
    - Structured data storage
    - Shortcuts
        - Model driven approach can compensate for inaccurate or missing data
        - Leverage FPGAs for more data
        -
